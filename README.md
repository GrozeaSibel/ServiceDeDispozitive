This project is a web-based system designed for a device service company to streamline customer and service management. It allows clients to register, submit devices for repair, track service history, and view invoices. Administrators can manage users, assign technicians to repairs, and generate reports on service usage and customer activity.

The system provides a secure authentication mechanism, ensuring that users access only the functionalities relevant to their roles. Clients can update their personal information, view available repair services, and estimate costs before submitting a device. They can also track the status of ongoing repairs and access their invoices directly from the platform.

Administrators have full control over the system, allowing them to manage user accounts, assign technicians to pending repairs, and monitor completed services. They can generate detailed reports on customer activity, track service trends, and identify high-value clients based on repair frequency and total invoices. Additionally, administrators can remove inactive technicians and ensure the proper allocation of resources.

Technicians can view their assigned repairs, update statuses, and log service details, helping maintain an organized workflow. The system ensures smooth coordination between clients, administrators, and technicians, enhancing overall efficiency.

The application is built using Node.js (Express.js) for backend processing, MySQL for structured data management, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. It leverages RESTful APIs for seamless communication between the client interface and server. Data integrity is maintained through foreign key constraints, ensuring reliable relationships between customers, devices, repairs, and invoices.
