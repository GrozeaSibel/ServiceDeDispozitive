This project is a web-based system designed for a device service company to streamline customer and service management. It allows clients to register, submit devices for repair, track service history, and view invoices. Administrators can manage users, assign technicians to repairs, and generate reports on service usage and customer activity.

The application is built using Node.js with Express.js for the backend, MySQL for the database, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. It provides secure authentication and role-based access control to ensure data integrity. The system handles CRUD operations for managing users, devices, repairs, and invoices efficiently.

Clients can register and log in to manage their profiles, add devices for repair, track the status of their requests, and access invoices. Administrators oversee customer management, assign technicians to repairs, finalize completed services, and generate reports on business performance. The system also supports identifying top customers, tracking financial transactions, and analyzing service trends.

The database is structured with relational tables and optimized queries, using JOINs and subqueries for efficient data retrieval. Constraints such as NOT NULL, UNIQUE, and FOREIGN KEY ensure data consistency.

This project improves workflow automation for repair management, enhances customer service, and simplifies invoice tracking, provi
